## Install and run

Installed npm package "serve" to serve the files. Configuration in "serve.json".
Run its npm package binary using
"npx serve"
Or (since I added an "scripts" entry for "start" in "package.json")
"npm run start"

The browse to relevant *.html. (Note bothering to serve because Chrome forbids a file URL due to CORS.)
